* JLife
  Calender, Todo list, Organizer
  One CLI to do them all

** Concepts
*** Boards
    Boards are seperate workspaces. 
    Eg) I might have a School board, a SPEAR board, and a Personal Board
    
*** Item
    A task, reminder, or meeting
    
*** Task
    Something that gets done.
    Eg) A bug, a feature, or a todo item
*** Reminder
    Something to bring to mind
    Eg) Wish someone happy birthday
*** Meeting
    Somewhere I need to be. Has a start and duration
    Eg) Exam, meeting, game, shift
    
*** Due/Persistant
    Tasks and reminders can either have a due date, or be persistant.
    Meetings are always due. Tasks will be late after the due date,
    reminders will trigger at the due date, and meetings start at the
    due date.

*** Repetition
    Any due item can repeat. n-days, n-weeks, n-months, and custom
    week can be set as repetion modes. Custom weeks might be something
    like MoWeFr, TuTh, or SaSu
    
** Interface
   The idea with the cli is to be as forgiving as possible. Accept much  
  
** Interface Examples
*** New items
    =jlife task fix the stupid bug --due tomorrow@8am=
    =jlife meeting spear leads --due th@7:30pm --repeat weekly --duration 30m=
    =jlife reminder brush teeth --due 8:30pm --repeat daily=
    =jlife reminder go to work --due 8:30 --repeat MoTuWeThFr=

*** Remove items
    Removes items as if they never existed
    - can use a substring of the item, or an index
    =jlife remove go to work=
    =jlife rm go to work=
    =jlife rm 1=
*** Dismiss items
    Completes tasks, dismisses reminders
    - done, finish, and dismiss are interchangable
    - can use a substring of the item, or an index
    =jlife done go to work=
    =jlife finish go to work=
    =jlife dismiss 1=
    
*** Display items
    - raw data :: =jlife display json=
    - raw data :: =jlife display sexp=
    - todo list :: =jlife display tasks=
    - calander :: =jlife display calender=
    - list of meetings :: =jlife display meetings=
    - list of reminders :: =jlife display reminders=

** Roadmap

*** TODO data structure for items
*** TODO cli parsing for creation, dismissing, and removing
*** TODO persistant storage
*** TODO multiple boards
*** TODO pretty displaying
*** TODO eventual consistancy cloud storage
